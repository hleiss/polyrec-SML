Installation guide for Poly Rec under SML/NJVersion 110.0.3
-----------------------------------------------------------

1. You need SML/NJ Version 110 with sources and compilation manager CMB. 

   If you don't have the compilation manager installed, use SML/NJ's
   config/install.sh and config/targets to install it with target 
   sml-full-cm. 

2. If you have unpacked the distibution tar-file of PolyRec in the
   root directory of SML/NJ (called <sml-97> below), this file is now 

	<sml-97>/polyrec/doc/INSTALL_NOTES

3. Go to the root directory of the compiler:

	> cd <sml-97>/src/sml-nj  

   Save the file describing how to build the original compiler:

	src/sml-nj> mv all-files.cm all-files.cm.orig

   and replace it with the one describing how to build the compiler with 
   Poly Rec:

	src/sml-nj> cp ../../polyrec/all-files.cm all-files.cm

4. Now call the batch compiler in the root directory of the compiler:

	src/sml-nj> ../../bin/sml-cm    (resp. ../../bin/sml-full-cm)

   With the batch compiler SML/NJ [CM&CMB], evaluate

	CMB.make();  

   This will recompile the compiler sources with some source files exchanged 
   by those of the polyrec directory (cf. all-files.cm), and generate new .bin 
   files. Having finished, leave the batch compiler by evaluating

	^D

5. The new bin-files have to be loaded into an empty run-time system and
   combined in a heap image. Copy

	src/sml-nj> cp ../../polyrec/doc/xmakeml-polyrec .

   to the source directory of the compiler and execute it, to create a heap
   image with the name "sml-pr" (or any other you like):

	src/sml-nj> xmakeml-polyrec -o sml-pr   

6. Step 5 generates a heap image  sml-pr.<architecture>. Move it to the 
   bin-directory 

	src/sml-nj> mv sml-pr.<architecture> ../../bin/.heap/.
	src/sml/nj> cd ../../bin 

   and create a symbolic link as follows:

        bin> ln -s .run-sml sml-pr
  
7. Now you can call 

        bin> sml-pr

   and use  SML/NJ Version 110 [Poly Rec]. See polyrec/doc/USER_MANUAL 
   on how to switch between the type systems or how to inspect type 
   inference in Poly Rec.

   You may wish to restore the original all-files.cm
