1.Correctness proof: 
	
	polyrec.cisbericht.95-88.ps.gz

  This file contains a detailed correctness proof for the 
  earlier version 1.3 of the type checker. The current 
  version (1.5) gives a different treatment of the `mono-
  morphic constraints': (cf.user manual)

  These are now recorded when passing a declaration, with 
  the effect that the typing of variables no longer adds
  constraints that may be withdrawn when typing enclosing 
  lambda-bindings. 

  Thus the correctness of the lambda case would be much 
  *simpler* for the current version.

  A short version of this report will soon appear in 
  Theoretical Computer Science, 199?.

2.Documentation of the implementation: 

	polyrec.cisbericht.95-88.ps.gz

  This also refers to an earlier version (1.1); it gives
  detailed information about how the SML/NJ 0.93 type checker
  worked and how it was modified. Documents the functions
  added for handling semiunification constraints and the 
  modifications of the type checker.

  However, SML/NJ Version 110 has changed the datatypes
  of types somewhat, and the code of Poly Rec acounts for
  that and has been improved (to remove bugs found while
  doing the correctness proof). Performance is somewhat
  worse than reported in Section 6, because of additional 
  checks needed for the correctness.

3.Examples:

	polyrec.threeExpls.dvi.gz

  contains a treatment of three examples where the constraint
  solving is done by hand. (Written before the implementation
  was made).
