# polyrec-SML

To answer a request by Fritz Henglein and Martin Elsman of DIKU, U
Copenhagen, I make available an implementation of Standard ML of New
Jersey (SML/NJ) with a modified typechecker that uses polymorphic
rather than monomorphic recursion (i.e. Milner/Mycroft rather than
Damas/Milner type system).

The code was written by Martin Emms and myself in 1995 for smlnj-0.93
and adapted to smlnj-110.0.3 in 1998 while we were employed at
Ludwig-Maximilans-Universität München (LMU).

I have adapted the code to smlnj-110.99.3, the latest stable version
of SML/NJ, available from https://github.com/smlnj/legacy. For
explanation and examples see the README and examples.sml files in the
subdirectory doc, but use INSTALL_NOTES.110.99.3 instead of those in
doc.
